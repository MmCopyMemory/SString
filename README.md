# SString : Compile time string encryption c++17+
<br>

- Unique key generation similar to skcrypt via metadata

- Tiny

<br><br>
This is not amazing or mindblowing work.<br>
It has quite some overhead, which to be honest I dont know if its good compared to f.x. [SkCrypter](https://github.com/skadro-official/skCrypter). <br><br>

## Performance

- **CPU Cycles (Decryption)**: 514 cycles
- **CPU Cycles (Without Encryption)**: 14 cycles
Timewise difference is <0ms <br>
<br>
Anyways enjoy :)
